##Codepath HW 1: TED MUSIC APP Demo

Wanted to challenge myself to do a different app other than the Rotten Tomatoes app, but still meet the basic requirement.
The TED API ended up not being as straight forward and it costed me a lot of hours. I ended up scrapping the TED API and using PARSE Overall, I probably spent **15 - 20 hours** on this assignment. 

Requirements Met:

- User can view a list of movies from Rotten Tomatoes. Poster images must be loading asynchronously. (Although, this is largely provided by Parse)
- User can view movie details by tapping on a cell
- User sees loading state while waiting for movies API. You can use one of the 3rd party libraries at cocoacontrols.com.
- User sees error message when there's a networking error. You may not use UIAlertView to display the error. See this screenshot for what the error message should look like: network error screenshot.
- User can pull to refresh the movie list.
- Customize the navigation bar. (optional)

Issues:
- I spent a couple of hours trying to add a launch screen but was unable to get it to work
- I would like to extend this app to play the TED videos. I was unable to get the video working before the assignment deadline.
- Could not get LiceCap to work for animated gif. When launched an empty window appears and then it crashes.
- I also could not set the size of the animated gif attache in this readme
